# Real-time Speech Recognition System

## Motivation

In the audiovisual industry, accessibility is a growing need. As a developer who works with audiovisual production, I understand the importance of making any content accessible to all audiences. This real-time speech recognition system appears as a solution to allow any content to be accessible at a low cost. Using this tool, you can generate live captions for your broadcasts, making access easier for people with hearing impairments and expanding your reach to audiences who speak different languages.

## How it works

This system uses the browser's speech recognition API to transcribe audio in real time. To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Open the HTML file in a supported browser (Google Chrome recommended).
2. You will be asked to give permission to access your microphone. Grant the necessary permission.
3. Select a microphone from the list of available microphones.
4. Click the "Start" button to begin transcription.
5. Speak into the selected microphone and see subtitles generated in real time on the screen.

### Specifying a Language

You can specify a language for the transcription by adding the `?lang=` parameter to the URL. For example, to use English, you would use the URL `yoursite.com?lang=en-US`. If no language is specified, the default will be Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`).

## Default Language Table

| Language Code | Language Name |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| pt-BR | Portuguese (Brazil) |
| en-US | English (US) |
| es-ES | Spanish (Spain) |
| fr-FR | French (France) |
| de-DE | German (Germany) |
| it-IT | Italian (Italy) |
| ru-RU | Russian (Russia) |
| ja-JP | Japanese (Japan) |
| zh-CN | Chinese (China) |



## Conclusion

This system offers a simple and cost-effective way to make audiovisual content more accessible to a wider audience. We hope this tool is useful for your audiovisual production needs.
