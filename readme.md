## Motivation

In the audiovisual industry, accessibility is a growing need. As a developer who works closely with the audiovisual production, I understand the critical importance of ensuring content is accessible to all audiences. This real-time speech recognition system emerges as a solution to facilitate low-cost accessibility, allowing live captions for broadcasts. It not only aids individuals with hearing impairments but also significantly expands your reach to non-native audiences by offering real-time translations in various languages.

## Features

- **Real-time Transcription**: Leveraging the browser's speech recognition API, it transcribes audio in real time, displaying live captions on your screen.
- **Customizable Interface**: Adjust text size, background color, and text color to suit your preferences and improve readability.
- **Language Flexibility**: Easily switch between multiple languages for transcription with just a simple modification in the URL.
- **Automatic Preferences Saving**: Your customized settings are automatically saved in the browser‚Äôs local storage, ensuring a consistent user experience even after a browser refresh or reopening the tool at a later time.

## How it Works

1. Open the HTML file in a supported browser (Google Chrome recommended).
2. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted to access your microphone.
3. Select a microphone from the available list.
4. Click the "Start" button to initiate the transcription process.
5. Speak clearly into the selected microphone, and watch the real-time captions appear on the screen.
